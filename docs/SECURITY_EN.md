## Technical Issue Description

### Affected Scope

**Affected Service**: Xbox Store (Nigeria Market)
**Issue Type**: Shopping cart functionality anomaly
**Severity**: Medium (affects user experience, but no sensitive data exposure)

### Technical Details

Main manifestations of the issue:

1. **Inconsistent Market Identifiers**: Different API calls use different market codes
2. **Session Management Anomalies**: Cart ID transmission failures between requests
3. **Regional Validation Logic Errors**: Some regional users cannot complete purchases normally

## Security Considerations

### Tool Security

#### 1. Data Processing
- **Local Processing**: All data modifications occur on client devices
- **No Data Collection**: Tool does not collect or transmit any user data
- **Temporary Storage**: Only temporarily stores necessary session identifiers

#### 2. Network Security
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All communications maintain original encryption
- **Certificate Verification**: Maintains original SSL/TLS security mechanisms
- **Domain Restriction**: Only effective for specific Microsoft domains

#### 3. Privilege Minimization
- **Precise Matching**: Only intercepts specific API requests
- **Read-Only Access**: Most operations are read-only analysis
- **Graceful Degradation**: Script failures don't affect normal functionality

### Potential Risks

#### 1. MITM Risk
**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle interception could be maliciously exploited

**Mitigation**:
- Use trusted proxy tools
- Regularly update certificates
- Use only in trusted network environments

#### 2. Script Integrity
**Risk**: Remote scripts could be tampered with

**Mitigation**:
- Use official GitHub Raw links
- Regularly check script content
- Consider using local script files

#### 3. Terms of Service
**Risk**: May violate Microsoft Terms of Service

**Mitigation**:
- Use only to resolve technical issues
- Not for malicious purposes
- Follow local laws and regulations
